=head1 NAME

plerdall - Publish an entire Plerd blog from source

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In /path/to/plerd/conf/plerd.conf:

 base_uri: http://blog.example.com path: /home/me/Dropbox/plerd title:
 My Lovely Blog

And then, on the command line, while in the top-level plerd directory:

 bin/plerdall

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script directs Plerd to completely publish a blog, once, based
configuration. If the blog's already been published, then it'll get
wholly and freshly republished.

For instructions on installing and using Plerd, please see the README
file that should have accompanied this distribution. It is also
available online at L<https://github.com/jmacdotorg/plerd#plerd>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 send-webmentions

 bin/plerdall --send-webmentions

B<Experimental.> After publishing all the blog's posts, Plerd will then
direct every post to scan itself for hyperlinks and attempt to send
webmentions to each one.

=head2 process_webmentions

 bin/plerdall --process-webmentions

B<Experimental.> Before publishing all the blog's posts, Plerd will
check to see if any new webmentions are waiting in its webmention-inbox.
If so, it will process those webmentions. Then, if at least one of those
received webmentions is valid, Plerd will republish all the blog's
posts. If neither of the prior conditions are true, Plerd will not
republish the blog.

This flag makes plerdall suitable for use as a scheduled task, via e.g.
cron.
